## Install SSL on Vito instance

If you've installed VitoDeploy on a VPS, By default your Vito instance will be accessible via your server's IP address which is not secure.

To secure it you need to attach a domain to it and get an SSL certificate for it.

### Attach a domain

Create an A record on your domain's DNS manager and point it to your Vito server's IP address.

:::warning
If you are using Cloudflare make sure you have the cloud proxy off at this stage!
:::

Open `/etc/nginx/sites-available/vito` with an editor on your terminal like `nano`:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/vito
```

Edit it like the following and add your domain to it:

```
server {
    ...
    server_name _ YOUR_DOMAIN_GOES_HERE;
    ...
}
```

Now run the following command to restart the webserver:

```sh
sudo service nginx restart
```

Make sure your webserver is not broken:

```sh
sudo service nginx status
```

It should have something like this:

```
‚óè nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-04-10 11:11:32 UTC; 3 days ago
       Docs: man:nginx(8)
   Main PID: 172473 (nginx)
...
```

Now open your domain to make sure it is ok and can be opened.

### Get SSL

Now you need to run the following command to generate the SSL

```sh
sudo certbot --force-renewal --nginx --noninteractive --agree-tos --cert-name YOUR_DOMAIN -m YOUR_EMAIL -d YOUR_DOMAIN --verbose
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders:

YOUR_DOMAIN: Your domain address like example.com

YOUR_EMAIL: Your email address to be provided to letsencrypt
