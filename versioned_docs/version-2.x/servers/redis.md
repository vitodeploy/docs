# Redis

Vito installs the latest version of Redis by default on your server and binds `0.0.0.0` to it so you can access to it from outside if redis's port is open on the [Firewall](./firewall)

:::warning
Important to know that Redis has its default port `6379` and it is closed on the Firewall by default
