### Vultr

### Custom

If your server provider is not listed here, you can use the `Custom` provider when creating a new server.

Your server must have the following requirements so Vito can provision it:

- The server must be running a fresh installation of Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04 x64.
- The server must be accessible externally over the Internet.
- The server must have root SSH access enabled.
- The server requirements should meet the following criteria or more: 1 CPU Core with 1GHz, 1GB RAM, and 10GB Disk space.
- The server must have curl installed.

## Scope

Server providers can be created under a specific project or globally.

If you create a server provider under a project, it will only be available for that project.

If you create a server provider globally, it will be available for all projects.

The reason of this feature is when you add a new user to VitoDeploy, you can control which server provider they can
access.
