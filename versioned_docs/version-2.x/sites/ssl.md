## Introduction

Vito supports SSL installation for your sites. It can issue a Letsencrypt Certificate for your website, or you can
install your own Certificate.

## Letsencrypt

Letâ€™s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA) that provides digital certificates to enable
HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites. It simplifies the process of securing websites by offering an automated mechanism to
issue, renew, and manage certificates without manual intervention.

:::info
Vito uses `certbot` to issue a certificate for your domain. certbot requires an email address for the certificate and
Vito uses your user's email address for this.

## Custom SSLs

You can also install your own Certificate. Vito will ask for your Certificate and Keys and will install them on your
server and Nginx.

:::info
Vito encrypts the input and stores in your Vito Instance's database.

## SSL for Subdomains/Aliases

VitoDeploy optionally allows you to install SSLs for your subdomains and aliases. You can check this option when you're
creating a new SSL.
