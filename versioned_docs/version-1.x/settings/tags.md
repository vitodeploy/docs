# Tags

Tags are labels that you can assign to your servers or sites to help you organize them. You can assign multiple tags to
a server or site, and you can also assign the same tag to multiple servers or sites. Tags are a great way to organize
your resources and group them together.

Vito allows you to create, update, delete, assign and unassign tags to your servers and sites.
