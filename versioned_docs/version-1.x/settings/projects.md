# Projects

Vito enables you to handle your different projects.

Every user in Vito can have multiple projects and the servers belong to projects. The relationship between servers and projects is one-to-many

## Creating a Project

To create a project you just need a unique name! Go to the Projects page and create a new one. It will appear in the left sidebar, Under Projects dropdown.

## Editing a Project

You can simply edit your projects name in the Projects page.

## Deleting a Project

Deleting a project is as easy as hitting the delete button and confirming that you want to delete it.
